        <p><br>Everyone rushes to their nearby AT&T and Verizon stores each year when a new Apple phone is released. With the introduction of the new phones, it appears they never modify the software. The timer on the clock app on my phone is one of the worst user experiences I've ever had. Although the software appears simple, mistakes can be made quickly. </p><br>
        <p>The software requires the user to select the timer's duration using a scroll wheel.</p><br>
        <img class ="overallScreen" src="../img/timer.png" alt="Apple Timer">
        <br><p>As you can see, it might be very simple for a user to enter the wrong time on the timer because both scroll wheels are located right near to one another. I have this issue frequently since I frequently utilize my phone's timer. The iPhone timer's user interface tries to be way too straightforward, which makes it very easy for mistakes to happen. I think it would be simpler to just let the user enter how long they want the timer to run for in order to make things easy for them. This can be accomplished by having the user type in the appropriate amount of time or by providing buttons that the user would click to display the appropriate time.</p>
